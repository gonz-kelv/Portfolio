		<h3>DRIVEN, CREATIVE & TECHNICAL</h3>
		<p>I'm a Network Administrator who enjoys scripting. I love to work with new technologies and implement innovative solutions. Its rewarding to help end-user with their challenges to improve their tasks and troubleshoot any errors. I want to automate processes and workflow to save time and be able to work on more valuable responsibility.</p>
		<p>I am an aspiring developer. I feel like a detective when I code. There is a problem that I need to solve and I am looking for the solution. Debugging leaves trails that will lead me to a clue on how to solve the case. In the end, its rewarding when I get the job done. Case closed!<p>
		<p>I love the world of technology. I am fascinated how it can help people do things more efficient. However, it can become a double edge sword where it can make us very inefficient hehe.</p>

		<h3>School:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Bachelors of Science in Interactive Arts and Technology (June 2016)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Projects</p>
		<h4>3D First-Person Arcade Fighting Game - Windows Platform</h4>
		<p>I was the lead programmer in the team. I suggested a strategy on how we are going to implement the game. During implementation, it did not work out as planned so I was able to quickly set out another strategy that will make us complete it in time.</p>
		<h4>3D Weather App - Angular Web App</h4>
		<p>I was one of the developers in the project. It was a challenge to merge our code together so I suggested a procedure so that we do not break our current build when adding new features. I worked with the designer on our 3D environment. When we were discussing about it, I was be able to suggest whether it would be feasible with the time constraint that we had or not.</p>
		<h4>ConceptuArt - Website with a Database</h4>
		<p>This was an individual project. I set out a plan that would be transferable in the different steps of creating the website. It was to set a scope for the plan, execute and implement, and then test it. In doing this, I was able to create a well structure database with important key information and a design layout that is simple, reactive and user-friendly. I was able to make my website function properly and include fixes for abnormal cases so it continues to work.</p>
