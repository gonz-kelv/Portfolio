# Progress & Design

I wanted to create my website with a videogame theme layout. I would like to get into the videogame industry. I grabbed inspiration from the direction pads usually controllers have and used that to navigate my viewer to sections of my website. I added the feature of users able to use arrow keys to navigate through the site. The website is heavily relying on JS for animations and layout so I accommodated a flat layout that will work with just CSS but no animation if the device is not capable to run JS.
